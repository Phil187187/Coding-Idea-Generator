      <h2 class="my-4">Overview</h2>
      <p>The Artificial Intelligence project is aimed at creating an intelligent system that can reason, learn, and act like humans. The project will involve building models that can analyze and interpret large amounts of data, and develop algorithms that can make predictions and decisions based on that data. This will be achieved by combining techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to build intelligent systems that can be used in a variety of settings.</p>
